# album95

album95 is a lightweight album-oriented music player for Windows 95 and later.

It is designed for old PCs and classic Windows environments, focusing on fast album browsing and simple playback.

The player is intentionally minimal and compatible with very old Windows systems.

```

```

## Build

A `Makefile` is included.

Tested build environment:

- MinGW g++
- `-std=gnu++98`
- Windows 95 compatible build settings

Example toolchain:

```
MinGW GCC 6.x
```


---

## BASS Dependency

album95 uses the **BASS audio library** by Un4seen for audio playback.

https://www.un4seen.com/

This project currently targets BASS 2.2.

The repository does **not include BASS binaries**.

Required runtime files:

```
bass.dll
bass_aac.dll
```


These must be obtained from the official BASS distribution.

The MinGW import library (`libbass.a`) can be generated from the DLL if necessary.

## Character Encoding

album95 reads metadata as UTF-8 and converts it to the current Windows ANSI code page.

This allows metadata to display correctly on different language versions of Windows.

Characters not supported by the system code page may appear as `?`.
